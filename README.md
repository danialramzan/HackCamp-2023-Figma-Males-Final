The recent news of the decriminalization of hard drugs in BC really moved us because itâ€™s a great first step to rehabilitate people who are affected by drug abuse, and really serves to erode the social stigma around them. Thus, we thought that creating an app which helps such victims of drug abuse in their journey of rehabilitation would really make a positive contribution to society. As per the BC Coroners Service, just in January 2023, there have been an average of 6.8 deaths per day, which really shows the problem hard drugs pose on our society.

"Breaking Bad Habits" is a supportive app dedicated to aiding individuals on their journey towards overcoming drug abuse. With personalized tools, resources, and a community-driven approach, our app empowers users to navigate rehabilitation easier for a healthier, substance-free lifestyle. This app provides a safe space for vulnerable people who have historically not been provided apt access to mental health support and counselling.

App idea:
- An app that people can use to keep a log of their daily progress, emotions, and challenges (if any) related to their drug rehabilitation.
- They can connect to mentors, and people who have previously overcome the same problems and can talk about their current state of progress and get more tips.
- Some sort of gamified system which reminds, and rewards the user to complete, ranging from some basic tasks like having food, drinking water regularly, etc. to some more complicated stuff like meditation. The rewards can be in form of points that reflect on their profile.
- This can be like BeReal where they are notified to do so-and-so task, and they can also take pictures of it and share it with peers, which also motivates them to follow suit.
- Immediate access to all emergency services on the click of a button, if ever so necessary
- A place where they can see if there are any councelling sessions going on nearby.

Essentially an app that helps in the rehabilitation process of those people who fell victim to drug abuse.
